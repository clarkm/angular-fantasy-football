========================

fantasy football live draft helper app with angularjs

to do:
[ ] put some sort of onbeforeunload function so the data isnâ€™t lost!
[ ] make a print stylesheet to hide everything but the teams. then have them stack (still need to think of a way to save/export the data!)
[ ] use gt and lt responsive stuff for the teams so they are responsive or so the team cards wrap â€” less than 760 should be stacked!
[ ] Example errors for *team* are: matching bye weeks or forgot kicker, def, te and team is almost full (team has every type of player)! write JS logic for this!
[ ] highlight players on your team if their bye weeks match. also think of other gotchas for fantasy football
[ ] make a select box that hits/loads a json object - like the one from google app engine
[ ] (table header click) sorting for individual teams is probably going to be needed.. not workingâ€¦. ðŸ˜” used the same logic as the players list on right but NO
[ ] settings: colors (theme from app.config): have to add a app.config to define the colors in angular material. docs: https://material.angularjs.org/latest/Theming/03_configuring_a_theme
[ ] settings: layout positioning (side-by-side or stacked - from app.config): have to add a app.config to define the colors in angular material. docs: https://material.angularjs.org/latest/Theming/03_configuring_a_theme
